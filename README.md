more to come. 

good candidate for a project board and then converting to issues. 
<br>Should be a nice project to bring people on OpenHacks into so they can get their feet wet.


Alright, Lets quick story this out. 

Often its a saturday and I want to program with some friends. <br>Or find something else to do. 

Considerations: 
1) level of interesting in the activity. ... they have to sell me on this. so that value can change. 
2) Distance at current time. ... distance relates to gas money<br> Im finding myself in mandarin. who am I gonna call? <br>Currently I have my go-to's<br>I'd like to remember those people.<br>But would be open to new possibilities.
3) How bad do they or I want to be included. 
4) Open to Ideas, Put up an issue. If youd like make a pull request on the readme ðŸ‘Œ.
